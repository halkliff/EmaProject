username: the username you use to log-in yande.re
password_hash: the hash of your password, used to log-in yande.re . If you don't have a password hash, do the following:
                - Get your normal password to log-in yande.re
                - go to http://www.sha1-online.com/
                - now format this string: choujin-steiner--{0}--
                    where the {0} is your password
                - done, now get the password hash and change into the appropriate place
                NOTE: IF THE PASSWORD HASH IS NOT FULFILLED, THE BOT WILL WORK, BUT WAY MORE LIMITED.
